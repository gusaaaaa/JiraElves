# ðŸŽ… Santa's Official Code of Conduct ðŸŽ„

## Introduction

At the North Pole, we believe in fostering a community where everyone feels welcome, valued, and heard. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior for all those who contribute to the Jira Elves project, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of the holiday season, we pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, elfishness, reindeer species, workshop department, level of magic, or sleigh driving skills.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.
- Spreading holiday cheer whenever possible.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of inappropriate language or imagery.
- Personal or political attacks.
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a magical workshop setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Santa Claus and the Chief Elves are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Santa Claus has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting Santa Claus at [santa@northpole.magic](mailto:santa@northpole.magic). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Santa Claus and the Chief Elves will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
