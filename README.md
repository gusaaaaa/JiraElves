**A collection of helpers for Jira users.**

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

The `jiraelf` script is a versatile tool designed to help you facilitate your Jira tasks. Here's how to get started:

### Commands:

1. **Expand**: Convert Jira links within a text into descriptive markdown links based on the tickets' titles.

   ```bash
   jiraelf expand
   ```

2. **List Release**: Display a list of issues related to a specific release.

   ```bash
   jiraelf list_release=RELEASE_NUMBER
   ```

For more detailed help, run:

```bash
jiraelf -h
```

## Quick Start üöÄ

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gusaaaaa/JiraElves.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd JiraElves
   ```

3. **Setup your Environment**:

   Create a `.env` file in the directory where you plan to run the script, and populate it with the following:

   ```
   JIRA_DOMAIN=your_jira_domain
   JIRA_USER=your_email
   JIRA_TOKEN=your_api_token
   ```

   Ensure that the `.env` file is properly set up before running the script.

4. **Install and Run the Script**:

   With the project cloned and the environment variables set up, you can now run the script:

   ```bash
   jiraelf COMMAND
   ```

   Replace `COMMAND` with one of the commands detailed in the **Usage** section.

5. If you're using the `expand` command, watch as your input text transforms into an output filled with descriptive markdown links!

## Troubleshooting üîç

### Mac Users: SSL or LibreSSL Warning

If you encounter a warning related to `urllib3` and SSL versions, such as:

```
urllib3 v2.0 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with 'LibreSSL 2.8.3'. See: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/3020
```

This indicates that the version of SSL library your Python installation is using isn't compatible with some of the required packages.

#### Solution:

To resolve this issue on macOS, you can install OpenSSL 1.1.1 using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install openssl@1.1
```

This will ensure your Python environment uses a compatible version of OpenSSL as required by certain packages like `urllib3`.

**Note**: Make sure to restart the terminal after installing openssl.
